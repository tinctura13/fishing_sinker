# Fishing weights calculator v2.0

I'm going to make it a Python package.

Add CLI and something else. 

Stay tuned!

Basic script that can help you to calculate the actual size of fishing sinkers depending on their weight.

My Bat'ko (Father in Ukrainian) asked me if I can help him with making some fishing sinker but the only thing he knew was their weight, and the material. 

Then I thought that I can code a computer program that will deal with it!

So, there are only two things you need to find the dimensions of the sinker - the weight of the sinker and the density of the material it is made of.
