# Fishing sinker calculator

Basic script that can help you to calculate the actual size of fishing sinkers depending on their weight.

My Batya (Father in russian) asked me if I can help him with making some fishing sinker but the only thing he knew was their weight, and the material. 

So, there are only two things you need to know find the dimensions of the sinker - the weight of the sinker and the density of the material it is made of.
