# fishing_sinker
Basic script that can help you to count the actual size of fishing sinkers depending on their weight.

My father asked me if I can help him with producing of some fishing sinker but the only thing he knows was their weight, and the material. 

So, there is only two things you need to know find the dimensions of the sinker - it's weight of the sinker and the density of material it made of.
